<p>As a senior solution architect, you will either work in a particular domain or across delivery teams in a portfolio, to find the best use of data, applications and technology for services and products that meet user’s needs.</p>
<p>You will own the overall technical vision for a set of solutions and work with delivery teams to assure the implementation of those solutions. You will also help to deliver business change and achieve organisational objectives.
You will be working in [for example] the Schools and Curriculum digital delivery portfolio, which includes services like Get help buying for your school, Start and manage an academy and Build or repair a school.</p>
<h2 id="the-role">The role</h2>
<p>Your main responsibilities will include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Defining, designing and maintaining the technical strategy for a group of services or business domain - keeping up to date with the latest technologies and trends, whilst delivering working solutions early and often.</li>
<li>Being responsible for the solution design and development of services of various sizes, including how they interact with their surroundings, and how they evolve over time.</li>
<li>Working with technical specialists in multiple projects and services, on problems that require broad architectural thinking.</li>
<li>Defining how we build and operate user-centred, open-source web systems in an agile environment, to serve a variety of citizen and government needs.</li>
<li>Challenging entrenched practices, looking for deeper underlying problems to solve, and larger opportunities for digital transformation.</li>
<li>Communicating the vision for government services to developers and non-developers alike, working in multi-disciplinary teams that bring policy and delivery together.</li>
<li>Playing an active role in the DfE Architecture community, related communities of practice / interest and events, where you will share your knowledge of best architecture practice, tools and techniques</li>
<li>Helping to build a diverse, inclusive culture across the technical architecture community, growing awareness, inclusivity and balance.</li>
<li>Working with the Head of Profession, colleagues, and peers on profession-based activities (and cross-profession), such as defining standards and guidance around best practice.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="skills-you-need">Skills you need</h2>
<p>It is essential that you can demonstrate the following experience in your application and at the first stage interview:</p>

<li>Experience leading technical teams and delivering user-centred services in an agile environment.</li>
<li>Knowledge of open source principles and technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the following essential criteria will also need to be demonstrated at the second interview stage:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ability to build consensus between diverse and often conflicting interests, working with technical and non-technical stakeholders to achieve agreement on technical plans.</li>
<li>The ability to look beyond immediate technical problems and identify the wider implications.</li>
<li>Practical knowledge at many levels of the web stack, from front-end code, down to infrastructure and networking.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is desirable that you demonstrate the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Experience of applying the UK Government Service Standard and service assessment.</li>
<li>Experience of software development in either Ruby, .Net or similar.</li>
<li>Experience of practices such as Test-Driven Development (TDD), continuous integration, automated deployment pipelines, version control with Git and DevOps.</li>
<li>Experience of mentoring and supporting colleagues in multi-disciplinary teams, one-to-one or in groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that desirable criteria will only be considered to make an informed decision in the event of a tie.</p>
<h2 id="selection-process">Selection process</h2>
<h3 id="application">Application</h3>
<p>Candidates should complete the advertised Civil Service Jobs application by submitting a completed application form and CV, explaining how they meet the essential criteria specified under the Selection Criteria heading in the advert.</p>
<p>CV details need to be included in the template within the application form which is accessible through the Civil Service Jobs advert. Emailed CVs will not be considered.</p>
