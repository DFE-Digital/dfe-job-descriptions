# Solution Architect

## Summary

These are exciting times at the Department for Education. In 2022 we'll continue to build services for all our users – children, adults and those in social care.

Our diverse and inclusive culture reflects the society we live in. This helps us to achieve better outcomes for all our users. See what our team have to say in our [DfE digital culture video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgS-yJKR4Z4).

We work in multi-disciplinary teams using Agile methods to innovate and radically improve services that:

- Raise education standards and provide the best start in life for children
- Support disadvantaged and vulnerable children and young people
- Drive economic growth

You can read more about our strategy on the [DfE digital and technology strategy blog](https://dfedigital.blog.gov.uk/).

As a Solution Architect, you will either work in a particular domain or across delivery teams in a portfolio, to find the best use of data, applications and technology for services and products that meet user’s needs.

You will own the overall technical vision for a set of solutions and work with delivery teams to assure the implementation of those solutions. You will also help to deliver business change and achieve organisational objectives.
You will be working in [for example] the Schools and Curriculum digital delivery portfolio, which includes services like Get help buying for your school, Start and manage an academy and Build or repair a school.


## The role

Your main responsibilities will include:

- Defining, designing and maintaining the technical strategy for your service(s) - keeping up to date with the latest technologies and trends, whilst delivering working solutions early and often.
- Being responsible for the solution design and development of services of various sizes, including how they interact with their surroundings, and how they evolve over time.
- Working with technical specialists in multiple projects and services, on problems that require broad architectural thinking.
- Defining how we build and operate user-centred, open-source web systems in an agile environment, to serve a variety of citizen and government needs.
- Challenging entrenched practices, looking for deeper underlying problems to solve, and larger opportunities for digital transformation.
- Communicating the vision for government services to developers and non-developers alike, working in multi-disciplinary teams that bring policy and delivery together.
- Playing an active role in the DfE Architecture community, related communities of practice / interest and events, where you will share your knowledge of best architecture practice, tools and techniques
- Helping to build a diverse, inclusive culture across the technical architecture community, growing awareness, inclusivity and balance.
- Working with other architects, colleagues, and peers on profession-based activities (and cross-profession), such as defining standards and guidance around best practice.

It is essential that you can demonstrate the following experience in your application and at the first stage interview:

- Experience of working with stakeholders to make decisions on technology choices, using the most appropriate languages, frameworks and tools to meet user and business needs.

- Knowledge of open source principles and technologies.

In addition, the following essential criteria will also need to be demonstrated at the second interview stage:

- The ability to work with technical and non-technical stakeholders to achieve agreement on technical plans.
- The ability to look beyond immediate technical problems and identify the wider implications.
- Practical knowledge at many levels of the web stack, from front-end code, down to infrastructure and networking.

It is desirable that you demonstrate the following:

- Experience of applying the UK Government Service Standard and service assessment.
- Experience of software development in either Ruby, .Net or similar.
- Experience of practices such as Test-Driven Development (TDD), continuous integration, automated deployment pipelines, version control with Git and DevOps.
