# Enterprise Architect

## Summary

These are exciting times at the Department for Education. We are transforming to become a user-centred organisation, delivering better outcomes for all our users.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgS-yJKR4Z4) gives an insight into the culture which is being developed within some of the teams.

As an Enterprise Architect, you will​ ​partner with senior DfE business, strategy and policy leads and stakeholders across the department, to demonstrate the business value of Enterprise Architecture as an enabler of strategy formulation, business change and technology innovation. You will collaboratively develop business capability models and roadmaps to facilitate discussion and decision making

You will be working in [for example] the Schools and Curriculum digital delivery portfolio, which includes services like Get help buying for your school, Start and manage an academy and Build or repair a school.

## The role

All​ ​architects​ ​within​ ​Government​ ​are​ ​​responsible​ ​for​ ​the​ ​design​ and build​ of​ both solution and technical​ ​architectures​. It is their job to communicate ​​the​ ​vision​ ​for​ ​government services​ ​to​ ​developers​ ​and​ ​non-developers​ ​alike.​ ​You’ll​ ​thrive​ ​using​ ​agile​ ​methods​ ​and enjoy​ ​working​ ​with​ ​departments​ ​and​ ​in​ ​multidisciplinary​ ​teams.​ ​Above​ ​all,​ ​you’ll​ ​want​ ​to make​ ​government​ ​better,​ ​which​ ​may​ ​sometimes​ ​involve​ ​challenging​ ​the​ ​status​ ​quo.

You will lead analysis of the organisation’s future-state capabilities and current / future IT environment, to detect critical deficiencies and recommend solutions for improvement, driving the organisation forward. To do this, you will have​ ​a​ ​good​ ​understanding​ ​of​ ​a​ ​broad​ ​range​ ​of​ ​technologies and​ ​the ability​ ​to​ ​take​ ​a​ ​balanced​ ​approach​ ​to​ ​technology​ ​selection. You’ll be able​ ​to​ ​converse​ ​easily​ ​with​ ​and​ ​translate​ ​between​ ​non-technical​ ​stakeholders and​ ​technical​ ​practitioners. ​ ​You’ll be able to​ ​switch​ ​between​ ​different​ ​problems​ ​and responsibilities​ ​and​ ​be directly​ ​involved​ ​in​ ​service​ ​delivery.

You could be working on anything from transforming core technology services to architecting substantial digital services [for example] the Schools and Curriculum digital delivery portfolio, which includes services like Get help buying for your school, Start and manage an academy and Build or repair a school. Other examples of our services include [​​Find​ ​an apprenticeship](https://www.findapprenticeship.service.gov.uk/apprenticeshipsearch)​,​ ​​[School​ ​performance​ ​tables](https://www.gov.uk/school-performance-tables)​,​ ​​[Get​ ​information​ ​about​ ​schools](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/)​ and​ ​​[Get​ ​into teaching](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/). O​ur​​ services​ ​are​ ​​developed​ ​by​ ​multi-disciplinary​ ​teams​ ​using ​a​ ​variety of​ technologies​ - ​​you​ ​would​ ​ideally​ ​have​ ​experience​ ​across multiple platforms, technologies and delivery methodologies.

You’ll​ ​undertake​ ​structured​ ​analysis​ ​of​ ​technical​ ​issues,​ ​translating​ ​this​ ​analysis​ ​into ​designs​ ​that​ ​describe​ ​a​ ​solution. ​You​ ​can​ ​be​ ​consulted​ ​on​ ​design​ ​and​ ​are capable​ ​of​ ​providing​ ​design​ ​patterns. ​ ​You​ ​can​ ​identify​ ​the​ ​deeper​ ​issues​ ​that​ ​need fixing​ ​and​ ​look​ ​for​ ​opportunities​ ​to​ ​collaborate​ ​and​ ​reuse​ ​components,​ ​communicating with​ ​both​ ​technical​ ​and​ ​non-technical​ ​stakeholders. Collaborating with other DfE leaders, you will help build an architecture capability that can deliver the DfE priorities, as well as supporting capability building across government.

You will have oversight of the work of architecture community members on projects, programmes and business as usual activities, ensuring work is of an appropriate standard. Where appropriate, you should lead by example and positively resolve issues collaboratively.

There will be opportunities to contribute to the development of the pan-government community and wider technology leadership across government.

## Key responsibilities

-   Working across a programme or group of projects aligned to a portfolio or domain, across DfE, to understand the needs of the delivery programmes and projects, defining suitable strategies, architectures and roadmaps to meet those needs.
-   Building ​and​ ​maintaining​ ​technical​ ​roadmaps, ​looking​ ​ahead​ ​for​ ​future​ ​opportunities​ or blockers,​ ​and​ ​ensuring​ ​decisions​ ​by​ ​service​ ​teams​ ​align​ ​with​ ​the​ ​strategy.
-   Advising​ ​on​ ​optimal​ ​architectures​ ​and​ ​ensure​ ​projects​ ​are​ ​run​ ​using appropriate assurance​ ​activities,​ ​best​ ​practice​ ​guidelines​ ​and​ ​appropriate ​methodologies.
-   Anticipating​ ​and​ ​mitigating​ ​against​ architecture challenges​ ​or​ ​risks within projects.
-   Defining​ ​and​ ​managing​ ​technical​ ​procurement​ ​requirements.
-   Involvement ​ ​in​ ​the​ ​wider​ ​development​ ​community,​ ​identifying​ ​good​ ​practices​ ​to adopt​ ​and​ ​share​ ​your​ ​experiences,​ ​e.g.​ ​through community meet-ups, blog posts and other collaboration channels
-   Advising ​Service Owners​ ​and their teams on​ ​the​ ​estimated​ ​effort​ ​and​ ​technical​ ​implications​ ​of current​ ​user​ ​stories, ​ ​as​ ​well​ ​as​ ​those​ ​in​ ​the​ ​backlog.
-   Help​ing to ​enable​ ​the​ ​reuse​ ​of​ ​patterns,​ ​tools,​ ​and​ ​components​ ​across​ ​the​ whole government​ ​service​ ​landscape.
-   Helping to mature architecture practice and profession to ensure what we deliver is strategically aligned and provides best value. Helping to maintain the architecture body of knowledge, developing standards and patterns that contribute back to wider technical communities.
-   Providing leadership and support in the architecture community (which may include line management), offering independent leadership to ensure issues are resolved positively across DfE.
-   Supporting the architecture community in DfE, ensuring a diverse group of people feel welcome, respected and supported, as well as supporting your counterparts in other parts of government in building an active community that everyone in architecture and leadership across government can belong to and participate in.
