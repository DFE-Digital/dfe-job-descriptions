## Summary

These are exciting times at the Department for Education. In 2022 we'll continue to build services for all our users â€“ children, adults and those in social care.

Our diverse and inclusive culture reflects the society we live in. This helps us to achieve better outcomes for all our users. See what our team have to say in our [DfE digital culture video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgS-yJKR4Z4).

We work in multi-disciplinary teams using Agile methods to innovate and radically improve services that:

- Raise education standards and provide the best start in life for children

- Drive economic growth
