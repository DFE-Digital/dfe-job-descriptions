# DfE DDaT job descriptions

This website collects and publishes standard job descriptions for DDaT roles in DfE. It is built using the [GOV.UK tech docs template](https://tdt-documentation.london.cloudapps.digital/).

It exists because we would like to be more consistent in our job adverts. More job descriptions, across other job families, will be added as they become available.

You can update the job descriptions by raising a pull request at [https://github.com/DFE-Digital/dfe-job-descriptions](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/dfe-job-descriptions).

To get help with this service, please post in the [#developers](https://ukgovernmentdfe.slack.com/archives/CAGBHB4JV) channel on DfE Slack.
