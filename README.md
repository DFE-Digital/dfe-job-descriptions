# DfE Job Descriptions

This is a repo to store the standard job descriptions we use across the DfE. Different areas of the department might want to tweak these when creating a job description specific to their area

Note: This is not a list of current vacancies

## Need some help adding/creating your profession's job descriptions using GitHub?
