## About the team

This is an exciting opportunity in the Teaching Vacancies team, which sits within the Teacher Services division.

Our mission in Teacher Services is to ensure excellent teachers for every child. We support candidates on their journey to become a teacher - from helping them find the right teacher training course to making it easy for them to find a teaching role through Teaching Vacancies.

[Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk) officially launched in April 2019. It is a free job listing service which helps schools to find the best new teachers, and saves schools time and money on recruitment. We also support teachers to easily search and apply for their next position. Teaching Vacancies is now the largest source of primary teaching jobs listed directly by schools in England. It’s also the second largest for secondary teaching jobs. Over 80% of schools are signed up to use the service.

Last year, our job listings were viewed over 2.5 million times by potential jobseekers. The challenge now is to build on our success by encouraging more schools and jobseekers to use Teaching Vacancies, and iteratively improving the service to better meet their needs.
